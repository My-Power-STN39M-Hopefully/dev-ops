# Dev Ops

This project will allow us to track **ORGANIZATIONAL WIDE DEV OPS PROJECTS**. Issues created here sould touch either **MULTIPLE MICROSERVICES** or for **CREATING NEW MIRCOSERVICES**. Any dev-ops issues related to a single microservice should be created for the repo that microservice is located within.

## First Time Developer Setup
_Must be done for each dev that works on the project. Please **do not** remove these instructions._

1. Set git remote head to development: 
```bash
git remote set-head origin development
```
